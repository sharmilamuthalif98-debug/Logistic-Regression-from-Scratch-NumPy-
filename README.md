# Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch-NumPy-
This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy and compares it with Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model on a binary classification dataset.  The performance metrics and learned coefficients are analyzed to highlight differences in accuracy, optimization, and interpretability between both models.
